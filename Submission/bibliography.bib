abstract = {The aim of this paper is to study the impacts of a reservation system for on-street parking. Such a system provides drivers looking for on-street parking with information on available parking spaces, thereby possibly reducing the need to cruise for parking and the accompanying negative externalities. The performance of the proposed system is studied using a highly detailed spatial agent-based simulation. The results of the simulations show that users of a reservation system benefit in terms of reduced search time and reduced walking distance under virtually all simulated circumstances. However, societal benefits are not as clear-cut. The benefit in search time for the users of the system comes at a cost to the regular drivers, which see a nearly identical increase in search time. In contrast, the positive impact on walking distance hardly influences walking distance for regular drivers. Hence, we conclude that the introduction of a reservation system for on-street parking results in a more efficient distribution of available parking spaces among drivers searching for parking.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present PARKAGENT, an agent-based, spatially explicit model for parking in the city. Unlike traditional parking models, PARKAGENT simulates the behavior of each driver in a spatially explicit environment and is able to capture the complex self-organizing dynamics of a large collective of parking agents within a non-homogeneous (road) space. The model generates distributions of key values like search time, walking distance, and parking costs over different driver groups. It is developed as an ArcGIS application, and can work with a practically unlimited number of drivers. The advantages of the model are illustrated using a real-life case from Tel Aviv. Taking detailed data from field surveys, the model is used to study the impact of additional parking supply in a residential area with a shortage of parking places. The PARKAGENT model shows that additional parking supply linearly affects the occurrence of extreme values, but has only a weak impact on the average search time for a parking place or the average walking distance between the parking place and the destination.},
